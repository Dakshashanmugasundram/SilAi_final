He had a nondescript childhood and was interested in helping people in distress, preferring gardening to joining sports with other boys. He attended Ravenshaw Collegiate School in Cuttack, where he learned Bengali and Sanskrit, as well as ideas from Hindu scriptures such as the Vedas and the Upanishads. Bose was also interested in Western education and wore Indian clothes while engaging in religious speculation. He was known to have a strong focus on his studies, competing, and succeeding in exams.

In February 1943, Bose left his wife and baby daughter and boarded a German submarine to travel to Japanese-occupied southeast Asia.

Bose also believed that a synthesis between communism and fascism could take hold in India, and he criticized Nehru's statement that there is no middle road between communism and fascism as \"fundamentally wrong.\" However, it is worth noting that the context does not provide enough information to fully understand Bose's political beliefs or to determine whether his ideas were compatible with other ideologies.\n",
